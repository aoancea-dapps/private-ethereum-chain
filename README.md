# Setup a private ethereum chain
In this series we will test the following techniques:
- create a private chain
- create accounts on the private chain
- send ether between the accounts on the private chain
- launch another node with the genesis block of the private chain
- connect the second node with the first node in the private chain
- import accounts from the first node in the second node - in order to be able to send ether through the second node from one account to the other
- send ether between the accounts on the private chain using the second node
